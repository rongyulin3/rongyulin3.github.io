I am Ron(Rongyu) Lin, currently an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the School of Computing & Engineering at Quinnipiac University.

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) and an MBA with STEM concentration in Data Science from Santa Clara University. Before joining Quinnipiac University, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Clark University and prior to that, I was the Principal Data Scientist at Capital One.

My research interests lie in the intersection of artificial intelligence and its applications across different domains. My current research focuses on:

- **Multi-fidelity and Multi-agent Interactive Engineering**: Integration of large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific data (imaging, spectroscopy, electrical measurements) and specialized learning agents for intelligent semiconductor design and optimization.
- **Computational Materials Discovery**: Development of multi-fidelity tools for atomic-level material properties prediction and device-scale optimization
- **Intelligent Design Automation**: Building knowledge-augmented frameworks for semiconductor system modeling and optimization
- **AI Cross-domain Applications**: Leveraging AI/ML solutions across finance, education, healthcare, and other industrial sectors

My research has been published in prestigious journals and conferences proceedings including Nature Communications, Journal of Physics, Journal of Materials Chemistry C, and ACL. I actively contribute to the scientific community as a reviewer or committee member for Transactions on Computational Science, Applied Intelligence, and Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence.

I am looking for highly motivated students who are interested in AI/ML applications in semiconductor design and computational materials science. If you are passionate about developing machine learning frameworks for scientific discovery, please email me your CV and research interests.

I am open to research collaborations and discussions. Please feel free to reach out via email!
